# Phase One Overview

## Objective
Implement the core daily loop end-to-end so a player can play a day, see progress, and understand when to return.

## Success Criteria
- A signed-in player can complete the daily loop from start to finish.
- Progress is clear (day index, completion state, and next-day availability).
- No blockers to replaying on the next calendar day.

## Not in Scope (Phase One)
- Factions or long-horizon economy systems.
- Deep narrative arcs beyond minimal storylets.
- Multiplayer depth or complex social graph features.
