Phase Two: Seasonal Forgetting ("Drop the Ledger")

Persistence rules
- Persists across seasons: anomalies discovered, hypotheses (theoryboard), public profile.
- Resets each season: daily_state (energy/stress/vectors/day index), time allocations, daily progression memory.
- Retained for analytics only: storylet_runs, events, micro_task_runs.

Rationale
Players remember the mystery and their theories, not the daily ledger of choices.
