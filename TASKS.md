## Needs Breakdown

> These tasks are too large to tackle as single items. Each needs a design/planning session to decompose into concrete steps before work begins. Pick one, break it down, then move the subtasks into the Backlog.

- [x] **BREAK DOWN: Define three evening event NPCs** — RESOLVED: (1) Caps party down the hall with drinks and girls, (2) Memory card game hangout, (3) SUB video games with snake minigame. `Priority: High` `Category: Design`
- [ ] **BREAK DOWN: Write s_the_contact** — Structurally complex: who is the contact (name, appearance, personality), what are the four directives exactly, how much does he reveal, what's the dialogue/choice tree, how do academic path hints surface, what's the anomaly warning tone. Needs design decisions before prose. `Priority: High` `Category: Content`
- [ ] **BREAK DOWN: Write s_dining_hall** — The biggest single storylet in the game. Introduces multiple new NPCs, three mutually exclusive evening invitations that branch the entire evening. Depends on evening NPC designs. Needs: scene structure, NPC introductions, invitation mechanics, choice architecture. `Priority: High` `Category: Content`
- [ ] **BREAK DOWN: Complete content creation agent** — Multi-part: audit current 3-stage pipeline for gaps, verify schema-reference.md matches current DB schema, run a worked example end-to-end (stage 1→2→3→JSON), fix any issues found, document the workflow. `Priority: Medium` `Category: Tooling`
- [ ] **BREAK DOWN: Build mini-game UI framework** — Entire subsystem: interrupt flow (how storylets trigger mini-games), component architecture (shared shell, game-specific renderers), result handling (success/failure → branch to different storylets), difficulty system (adaptive tracker, invisible to player), integration with storylet engine. At least 4-5 subtasks. `Priority: Medium` `Category: Engine`
- [ ] **BREAK DOWN: Map remaining Arc One storylets** — Needs a gap analysis first: audit existing storylets by day/segment/stream, identify holes in coverage, determine collision opportunities, then create individual storylet assignments. Can't be done in one shot. `Priority: Medium` `Category: Content`

## Milestones

| Milestone | Name | Key Deliverable | Status |
|-----------|------|-----------------|--------|
| A | "It Runs" | Game loop works with existing storylets. Play Day 1. | **~95% — engine + time system merged, needs opening content** |
| B | "It Squeezes" | Every slot has competing options. Two runs diverge. | Not started |
| C | "It Breathes" | Energy, money, skill create ambient pressure. | Not started |
| D | "They Remember" | NPCs respond to player history. | Not started |
| E | "It Means Something" | Reflection engine produces narrative summary. | Not started |
| F | "Play It Again" | Replay intention produces different-feeling run. | Not started |

## Notes

- **Milestone A is nearly complete.** The day engine, state manager, storylet resolver, consequence applier, save system, Supabase integration, and time system are all built and merged to main (PR #26). Remaining: opening content (revised dorm wake, quad reveal, contact, dining hall).
- **Only one design decision remains:** the three evening event NPCs (cards, caps, study hosts).
- **Gender rule:** Protagonist male. All dorm-floor NPCs and RA are male. Female NPCs exist on campus (classrooms, library, events). Sandra renamed to Scott.
- **Anomaly rule needs propagation.** Must be added to content-creator agent docs before new content.
- **Claude Code skills available:** `/new-storylet`, `/audit-content`, `/new-npc`, `/new-mini-game`, `/sync-board`
- **Session isolation matters.** One Claude Code session per focused task.
